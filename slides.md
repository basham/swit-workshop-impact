# Design With Impact

Statewide IT 2022 Workshop

Chris Basham

Notes:
Welcome everyone to this workshop. Today, we'll learn about a technique known as impact mapping. First, let's start with some background and logistics.



## Chris Basham

UX designer in Enterprise Student Systems.

*Accessibility. Front-end dev. Design systems.*

Notes:
I'm Chris Basham. I've worked at Indiana University since 2012, as a UX designer and front-end developer, working on various web software products. Over recent years, I've dived deeper into the topic of accessibility, and I want to share with you what I've learned regarding the intersection of these topics.



## Outline

| Time  | Duration | Description  |
| -----:| --------:| ------------ |
| 9:30  |      10m | Introduction |

| 10:25 |       5m | Break        |
| 10:30 |      60m | Part 2       |

Notes:
The workshop today is split into 3 major sections, over the course of 3 hours. Each section will be divided by 10 minute breaks.

Notes:
All resources for this workshop, including slides, slide notes, exercises, and links, are located on GitHub. Visit github.com/basham/swit-workshop-a11y. This link is posted in the Zoom chat.



## Zoom etiquette

- Submit questions in chat.
- Questions will be answered periodically.
- Mute when you're not talking.

Notes:
Because there's a lot to cover, I request you to submit any questions you have in the Zoom chat and keep yourself muted. I will then follow up with those questions periodically, between sections or after breaks.



## Impact mapping

Notes:
This workshop is about a technique known as impact mapping. I stumbled across it over this last year, and it has helped me and my development team better think through the work we do, before we start working.



## Examples

Notes:
Before explaining what an impact map is and why to use it, let's briefly look at a couple "classic" examples.



![Impact map with goal to increase mobile advertising](https://www.impactmapping.org/assets/im_template.png)

Notes:
Impact maps are arranged in a heirarchy, with each level having a unique meaning. A goal that is trying to be achieved is at the top, with everything below it representing things that will help to achieve that goal. In this example, the goal is to "increase mobile advertising" on a music information website.



![Impact map with goal to obtain 1 million active players](https://www.impactmapping.org/assets/gaming_example.png)

Notes:
Not all impact maps have to look the same. The structure can be more loose. Levels don't have to be labeled. It could look more like a mind map. In this second example, the goal is for a gaming platform to obtain 1 million active players.



## Problem solving

Cause → Effect

Notes:
A substantial amount of work we do in IT, the work we do in our personal lives, the work done in other disciplines and domains — can be described simply as problem solving. A cause will result in some effect. A particular solution will achieve a particular goal.



## Problem solving

Cause → Assumptions → Effect

Notes:
There is a lot between those ends. There is a lot of opportunities to get it wrong, to not achieve the desired effect or goal. Much of what prevents or hinders us from solving the problem is that we assume a particular cause will result in the desired effect.



## Assumptions

Unexamined. Unshared. Unproved.

Notes:
An assumption endangers a desired effect in three ways.



## Unexamined assumptions

Define the question.

Notes:
First, an assumption is unexamined when you may not be aware of it or when you may have not thought deeply about it. We can define what we do not know, by articulating it as a question.



## Unshared<br>assumptions

Communicate across disciples.

Notes:
Second, an assumption is unshared when it is not widely known. This breakdown easily happens across disciplines. For example, a designer may hand off a sketch of an interface to a developer. That sketch may include a button that behaves in a certain way that may be obvious to the designer and others in the design community, but it may not be obvious to a developer. Inevitably, a detail is overlooked which may have been caught earlier in the process. This may cause negative effects on the team or even on the end user experience.



## Unproved<br>assumptions

Verify with research.

Notes:
Third, an assumption is unproved when you do not verify that the cause will achieve the desired effect. Research helps to test hypothesises. You ask questions. You gather evidence. You analyze. If the hypothesis is proven wrong, you adapt and test again. If it is proven right, the hypothsis is verified, and you can move forward in confidence.



## Overcoming assumptions

||||
|---|---|---|
|Unexamined|→|Define|
|Unshared|→|Communicate|
|Unproved|→|Verify|

Notes:
In summary, as problem solvers, we need to have some way to define assumptions, communicate assumptions, and vertify assumptions. When we do this, we can more confidently know that a particular cause will result in the desired effect. Impact mapping helps us to do this.



## Assumptions

Solution-first → Goal-first
