# Design With Impact

Statewide IT 2022 Workshop

Chris Basham

Notes:
Welcome everyone to this workshop. Today, we'll learn about a technique known as impact mapping. First, let's start with some background and logistics.



## Chris Basham

UX designer in Enterprise Student Systems.

*Accessibility. Front-end dev. Design systems.*

Notes:
I'm Chris Basham. I've worked at Indiana University since 2012, as a UX designer and front-end developer, working on various web software products. Over recent years, I've dived deeper into the topic of accessibility, and I want to share with you what I've learned regarding the intersection of these topics.

Notes:
All resources for this workshop, including slides, slide notes, exercises, and links, are located on GitHub. Visit github.com/basham/swit-workshop-a11y. This link is posted in the Zoom chat.



## Zoom etiquette

- Submit questions in chat.
- Questions will be answered periodically.
- Mute when you're not talking.

Notes:
Because there's a lot to cover, I request you to submit any questions you have in the Zoom chat and keep yourself muted. I will then follow up with those questions periodically, between sections or after breaks.



## Agile

Deliver software in the right way.

Notes:
Iteration. Feedback. Learning.



## Product discovery

Deliver the right software.



## Impact mapping

A product discovery technique that is an input to the Agile process.

Notes:
This workshop is about a technique known as impact mapping. I stumbled across it over this last year, and it has helped me and my development team better think through the work we do, before we start working.



## Examples

Notes:
Before explaining what an impact map is and why to use it, let's briefly look at a couple "classic" examples.



![Impact map with goal to increase mobile advertising](https://www.impactmapping.org/assets/im_template.png)

Notes:
Impact maps are arranged in a heirarchy, with each level having a unique meaning. A goal that is trying to be achieved is at the top, with everything below it representing things that will help to achieve that goal. In this example, the goal is to "increase mobile advertising" on a music information website.



![Impact map with goal to obtain 1 million active players](https://www.impactmapping.org/assets/gaming_example.png)

Notes:
Not all impact maps have to look the same. The structure can be more loose. Levels don't have to be labeled. It could look more like a mind map. In this second example, the goal is for a gaming platform to obtain 1 million active players.



## Benefits

1. "Road map" for team and stakeholders
2. Communicates scope and priorities
3. Exposes assumptions

Notes:
The map can be a collaboration between the team and stakeholders, so there's an agreement of what is trying to be achieved. The number of items in the map roughly communicates the scope. The order of the items in the map communicates priorities. The connections of the items exposes assumptions.



## Problem solving

Cause → <span class="fragment">Assumptions →</span> Effect

Notes:
A substantial amount of work we do in IT, the work we do in our personal lives, the work done in other disciplines and domains — can be described simply as problem solving. A cause will result in some effect. A particular solution will achieve a particular goal.

There is a lot between those ends. There is a lot of opportunities to get it wrong, to not achieve the desired effect or goal. Much of what prevents or hinders us from solving the problem is that we assume a particular cause will result in the desired effect.



## Assumptions

Unexamined. Unshared. Unproved.

Notes:
An assumption endangers a desired effect in three ways.

A deliverable will cause a desired impact toward achieving a goal. An actor will contribute toward achieving the goal.



## Unexamined assumptions

Define the question.

Notes:
First, an assumption is unexamined when you may not be aware of it or when you may have not thought deeply about it. We can define what we do not know, by articulating it as a question.



## Unshared<br>assumptions

Communicate across disciples.

Notes:
Second, an assumption is unshared when it is not widely known. This breakdown easily happens across disciplines. For example, a designer may hand off a sketch of an interface to a developer. That sketch may include a button that behaves in a certain way that may be obvious to the designer and others in the design community, but it may not be obvious to a developer. Inevitably, a detail is overlooked which may have been caught earlier in the process. This may cause negative effects on the team or even on the end user experience.



## Unproved<br>assumptions

Verify with research.

Notes:
Third, an assumption is unproved when you do not verify that the cause will achieve the desired effect. Research helps to test hypothesises. You ask questions. You gather evidence. You analyze. If the hypothesis is proven wrong, you adapt and test again. If it is proven right, the hypothsis is verified, and you can move forward in confidence.



## Overcoming assumptions

||||
|---|---|---|
|Unexamined|→|Define|
|Unshared|→|Communicate|
|Unproved|→|Verify|

Notes:
In summary, as problem solvers, we need to have some way to define assumptions, communicate assumptions, and vertify assumptions. When we do this, we can more confidently know that a particular cause will result in the desired effect. Impact mapping helps us to do this.



## Structure

1. Goal
2. Actors
3. Impacts
4. Deliverables
5. Experiments

Notes:
Generally, the hierarchy of an impact map is composed of five layers: goals, actors, impacts, deliverables, and experiments.



## 1. Goal

What are you trying to achieve?

Notes:
The top of an impact map is the goal. Have one goal per impact map. The goal should answer the question, "What are you trying to achieve?"



## Personal goals

Health. Relationships. Experiences. Finances.

Notes:
Personal goals may involve improving your health, improving or creating relationships, having new experiences, or improving your financial situation.



## Business goals

Time. Money. Cost.

Notes:
Business goals may involve saving time, making money, or reducing costs.



## Governmental goals

Social welfare. Infrastructure. Security.

Notes:
Governmental goals is often more ambitious and broad. It may involve social welfare, infrastructure, or security.



## SMART goals

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-based

Notes:
Defining a goal is the most important thing to do, since all your work depends on it. A good goal typically follows some variation of the SMART pattern. It should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based.

## Go to the moon

President John F. Kennedy on Sept 12, 1962:

> [W]e shall send to the moon… a giant rocket…, and then return it safely to earth…, and do it first before this decade is out….
>
> [N]ew hopes for knowledge and peace are there.

Notes:
Let's take a look at one famous goal. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy outlined one in his "We choose to go to the Moon" speech. He says, "We shall send to the moon a giant rocket, and then return it safely to earth, and do it first before this decade is out." He adds that the reason to do this is "new hopes for knowledge and peace."

## The Eagle has landed

In July 1969, the crew of Apollo 11 landed on the moon, explored for over two hours, and returned safely to Earth.

Notes:
The goal was specific. It involved the moon and a rocket.

The goal was measurable. The crew collected 47.5 pounds of lunar material. The crew returned and survived. The U.S. was the first nation to do it.

The goal was achievable because the U.S. government invested in new companies, in tens of thousands of new jobs, in new technology, and in new materials.

The goal was relevant, because of the Cold War. The U.S. vowed to be first to the moon, so that "we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding."

The goal was time-based, because the deadline was December 31, 1969.

## Examples of goals

[List one to three goals.]



## 2. Actors

Who can help or hinder achieving the goal?

Individuals. Groups. Systems.



## Primary actors

Those whose goals are fulfilled.



## Secondary actors

Those who provide services.



## Off-stage actors

Those who have an interest but are not directly benefiting or providing a service.



## 3. Impacts

What should the actors do or not do to impact the goal?

Behavior change.



## 4. Deliverables

How will you help the actors make the intended impact?

Solutions.



## 5. Experiments

How can you verify whether the deliverable will have the intended impact?

Research. Evidence.



## Assumptions

Solution-first → Goal-first
