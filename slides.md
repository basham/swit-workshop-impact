# Design With Impact

Statewide IT 2022 Workshop

Chris Basham

Notes:
Welcome everyone to this workshop. Today, we'll learn how to incorporate accessibility in the design process. First, let's start with some background and logistics.



## Chris Basham

csbasham@iu.edu

UX designer in Enterprise Student Systems.

*Accessibility. Front-end dev. Design systems.*

Notes:
I'm Chris Basham. I've worked at Indiana University since 2012, as a UX designer and front-end developer, working on various web software products. Over recent years, I've dived deeper into the topic of accessibility, and I want to share with you what I've learned regarding the intersection of these topics.

Notes:
All resources for this workshop, including slides, slide notes, exercises, and links, are located on GitHub. Visit github.com/basham/swit-workshop-a11y. This link is posted in the Zoom chat.



## Zoom etiquette

- Submit questions in chat.
- Questions will be answered periodically.
- Mute when you're not talking.

Notes:
Because there's a lot to cover, I request you to submit any questions you have in the Zoom chat and keep yourself muted. I will then follow up with those questions periodically, between sections or after breaks.



## Annotate

Zoom → Toolbar → Annotate

Notes:
We may periodically use Zoom's annotation tools. So, let's get familiar with it. Look for the toolbar, that hovers over the screen. Click on the "Annotate" button to bring up annotation tools.



## Impact map examples
