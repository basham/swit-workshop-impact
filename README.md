## Description

Successful development teams both build the right products and build in the right way. The Agile methodology provides part the solution with iterative delivery, but the work is wasted if it ultimately doesn't solve real user problems or align with business goals.

Impact mapping is a simple and effective planning technique to help teams build the right things. Impact maps visualize how proposed or existing solutions affect user behavior and desired outcomes. Impact maps reduce uncertainty by surfacing assumptions in those solutions and identifying ways to validate those assumptions with research and data. Impact maps help to communicate the big picture, reveal opportunities, evaluate design direction, and shift the team's focus from solution-centered to user-centered.

During this workshop, participants will: learn how teams in Enterprise Student Systems are using impact maps; practice making impact maps with other participants; and receive resources to assist teams with adopting impact maps. This workshop will benefit team members of any role, but it will be especially useful for product owners, business analysts, and designers.

Chris Basham is a user experience designer in Enterprise Student Systems, specializing in accessibility, front-end development, and design systems.
